"""Explanation tasks with a checklist of required facts, for scoring a revision loop.

The generate -> critique -> revise cycle is the graph LangGraph is demonstrated with most
often, because it is exactly the shape LCEL cannot express: the critique node has to be able to
send control back to the generator, arbitrarily many times, based on what it finds.

Every demo of this pattern assumes more iterations help. This project tests that assumption by
scoring each revision against a **fixed checklist of facts the answer should contain** — the
same instrument as `langchain-llm` project 01's nullable fields, adapted to a different failure
mode. Where project 01 asked whether a model invents a value it lacks evidence for, this asks
whether a revision loop can *lose* a fact it already had, which a monotonic-improvement
assumption has no way to notice.
