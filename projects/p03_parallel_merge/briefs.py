"""Company briefs for a four-way parallel analysis, and what a complete synthesis must mention.

A fan-out / fan-in graph is the third common LangGraph shape: several analyst nodes run in
parallel, each covering one aspect of the same subject, and a synthesis node reads all of them
into one report. LangGraph itself will not let two branches silently clobber the same state key
— it raises `InvalidUpdateError` unless a reducer is declared — so the naive "silent overwrite"
story does not hold up; that was checked directly rather than assumed. Each analyst here writes
to its own key, which is how a graph like this is actually written, and the error goes away.

What does not go away: nothing stops one branch from **failing** — a tool call timing out, an
API returning an error — while the graph carries on and hands the synthesis node whatever that
branch produced, including nothing. The question this project asks is whether the synthesis
step notices and says so, or writes a fluent report that reads as complete regardless.

Each aspect has a **signature phrase**: distinctive vocabulary a synthesis genuinely covering
that aspect would use. Presence of the signature phrase is how "represented in the final
report" is measured — the same instrument as `langchain-llm`'s checklist scoring, applied here
to a fan-in rather than a fan-out.
